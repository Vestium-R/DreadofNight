If you want to add moves to this Hunter simply navigate to the Items section, and the module has all Innate Tasks along with Playbook moves premade for you!</p><img src=\"modules/dreadofnight/content/assets/pages/1actor3.png\" /><p>Note: There are some Moves most the \"create your own\" moves that require further editing to work as intended.</p><p>So lets say our Template Hunter is a Spectral Guardian, we'd open up the corresponding Folder and add all necessary abilities</p><img src=\"modules/dreadofnight/content/assets/pages/1actor4a.png\" /><img src=\"modules/dreadofnight/content/assets/pages/1actor4b.png\" /><p>This would be in this case Dual Souls, Spectral Pact, and 2 Basic moves of our choosing, we will choose Spectral Prowess and Spectral Motivation for this, simply drag and drop onto the Actor into the corresponding section to see the result:</p><img src=\"modules/dreadofnight/content/assets/pages/1actor5.png\" /><p>It is also recommended to add all the Innate Tasks especially if these Actors are being used by Player Hunters</p><img src=\"modules/dreadofnight/content/assets/pages/1actor6.png\" /><p>As a tip you can drag and drop each folder under Innate Tasks (Strength, Agility, Influence, etc) and it will add ALL moves listed under the folder. Once All Playbook moves and relevant Innate Moves are added now we can add equipment</p><p>This process is identical to how one adds Moves except under the equipment tab on the Actor sheet:</p><p>navigate to Items &amp; Gear in the Item tab and start drag and dropping! Lets give this Hunter a few things to get started</p><img src=\"modules/dreadofnight/content/assets/pages/1actor7a.png\" /><img src=\"modules/dreadofnight/content/assets/pages/1actor7b.png\" /><p>Do note that any MOVE or ITEM can be edited once on an Actor and it will not tamper with the original template from the Items tab allowing you to make additions to moves or upgrades to items individually</p><img src=\"modules/dreadofnight/content/assets/pages/1actor8.png\" /><p>Note if you are doing this with MOVES you can make adjustments based on relevant information, for example we gave this Spectral Guardian - Spectral Prowess this gives +1 to Traverse, Shove, Position, &amp; Finesse. So let us go into each of those and adjust the \"modifier\" by 1, now on this Hunter they may actively see the benefit of Spectral Prowess with out manually having to roll.</p><img src=\"modules/dreadofnight/content/assets/pages/1actor9.png\" /><p>Hopefully this was helpful, and may help hunters and GM's some neat tips on how to automate everything as smoothly as possible. We've worked hard to make as many Moves and Items able to use out of the box as possible but there are so many combinations we cannot account for some adjustments might be necessary.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":400000,"name":"Creating Actors (Monster/NPCs)","type":"text","_id":"qnKHzsH9eYcpWRmY","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Many features for creating Hunters apply to the creation of Monsters/NPCs, things like adding moves or items apply just the same, but there are a few differences we'd like to cover. Mainly the Actor sheet is slightly different between the two:</p><img src=\"modules/dreadofnight/content/assets/pages/2actor1.png\" /><p>They are a lot simpler and don't feature the 6 Attributes, the primary thing to know between NPC sheets and Hunter sheets is that while Items &amp; Gear can be shared between the two types of Character Sheets, MOVES cannot. Only Moves listed under Monster Moves are allowed to be on this type of Character, because of this duplicates of all Innate Tasks was created for the case of creating Guards, Villagers, or Human npcs/enemies.</p><p>Other than that almost everything works identical to the Hunter Sheets, simply drag and drop any Moves and Items and create your Monster or NPC. Do note that since many of the Monsters do not have Attributes, many of their Moves do not have any attributes associated with them, because of this it is recommended to manually roll Monster/NPC rolls, or if you have the time adjust the modifiers in a Monster/NPC's acquired Moves.</p><img src=\"modules/dreadofnight/content/assets/pages/2actor2.png\" /><p>As a way to help contain information we made an \"Attribute\" Item, that does not interact with any automated systems but can help you keep track of Monster/NPC attributes if desired:</p><img src=\"modules/dreadofnight/content/assets/pages/2actor3a.png\" /><img src=\"modules/dreadofnight/content/assets/pages/2actor3b.png\" />","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":500000,"name":"Creating Items (Moves)","type":"text","_id":"Pg6ifVRdH5Ld0fqn","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Similar to the creating Actors, when creating an Item there are a few variations upon initial setup.

Both Moves and NPC moves features a Description text along with Task Failure, Partial Success, Task Success, and Superior Success text.</p><img src=\"modules/dreadofnight/content/assets/pages/3item2.png\" /><p>If only the Description text is filled out then the Move will presume it is a \"Text only\" move simply displaying text when used, this is good for Moves that are passive (ie Spectral Prowess). Although if any of the text for Failures or any type of successes are filled, then the Move now assumes there is a roll. <br />Note: That even if a Move only has up to 11+ options I would recommend copying and pasting the 11+ text into the Superior Success text so that the Moves directions are still displayed.</p><p>As you can see the NPC moves, does not feature the \"Choice\" text option. the Choice text is something that appears at the bottom of the Move when rolled, regardless of the outcome, these is most useful for things like \"Investigate\" or \"Battle Inspiration\" that has holds and a list of options.</p><img src=\"modules/dreadofnight/content/assets/pages/3item3.png\" /><p>past the Description tab and into the Details tab, Moves and NPC moves differ quite drastically. Moves have a lot more options than NPC moves as you can see below:</p><img src=\"modules/dreadofnight/content/assets/pages/3item4.png\" /><p>The only thing they share is the Move Type, which is the category the Move will be listed under in their respective Actor Sheets</p><img src=\"modules/dreadofnight/content/assets/pages/3item5.png\" /><p>beyond this NPC moves has a roll formula and that is it. Regular Moves has a the \"Roll\" type, Modifier, Playbook, and Requires Move.</p><p>The Roll type chooses an attribute or other prompt to tie to the roll of a Move (if a roll is needed)</p><img src=\"modules/dreadofnight/content/assets/pages/3item6.png\" /><p>Modifier adds a flat number to the roll, regardless of Attribute, Forwards, or Ongoings. The Modifier tab is very useful for passive Moves that increase rolls on Tasks or Moves. Such as Spectral Look Out that gives +1 to Analyze tasks, simply go to the Innate Task Move \"Analyze\" add 1 to the modifier to represent the buff from Spectral look out.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":600000,"name":"Creating Items (Playbooks)","type":"text","_id":"W246PfVsCl1KadWo","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>The next \"Item\" we can create are playbooks, after creating the Playbook Item all it presents is the Description, in which you can add any information you deem necessary.</p><img src=\"modules/dreadofnight/content/assets/pages/4playbook1.png\" /><p>Although it does not interact with features directly it can be useful, for the Playbooks will appear in various locations such as the Actor Sheets and Moves.</p><img src=\"modules/dreadofnight/content/assets/pages/4playbook2.png\" /><img src=\"modules/dreadofnight/content/assets/pages/4playbook3.png\" />","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":700000,"name":"Creating Items (Equipment & Tags)","type":"text","_id":"Rigyr57aVRq18B94","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>The final Item type are Equipment (and Tags).
