The land of Gradina has been plagued by relentless beasts, horrors unseen, and despair beyond imagination since an event deemed “The Day of Beasts”. Take part in history as you explore a world that has been thrust into a new age of darkness and calamity. In this combat-oriented spin on the Powered by the Apocalypse TTRPG system, play as a  Monster Hunter (inspired by various Dark Fantasy media such as Berserk, Kimetsu No Yaiba, Dark Souls, Lord of the Rings and more!), as you traverse and defend a world dealing with Monsters for the first time, learn how to navigate this now-dilapidated land, and overcome the abominations that infest the fields you once called home!
